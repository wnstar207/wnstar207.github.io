    <h1>Stark Dreams</h1>
    <p>I don't own a business nor do I have any desire to, so this page is instead devoted to what my kids want to be when they grow up.</p>
    <p>Dani used to want to be some sort of engineer, working with computers and building things. He was even in his high school engineering academy. But, someone said something about how when you work for a company your ideas aren't really your own, or something like that, so he changed his mind. Now he wants to be a voice actor.</p>
    <p>Leo wants to be a SWAT officer. Really, he wants to be in the military, but he has a medical condition that will probably preclude that, so law enforcement is his next best idea.</p>
    <p>Sara wants to be a hair-dresser. She has also wanted to be a doctor, a lawyer, and a vet.</p>
    <p>Jesse wants to be a cop, or a "fighter-fighter" (that's how he used to say fire-fighter), or a surgeon.</p>
