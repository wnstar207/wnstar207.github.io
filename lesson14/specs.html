Company Description
The Temple Inn & Suites is a hotel chain headquartered in Bethesda, MD that builds and manages specialized hotel accommodations near temple locations of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints around the world.

Specifications
The following design and content-specific items are required in order to meet the functional specifications of this final project.

The site must be responsive to small, medium, and larger, wide screen views.

The home page is a contemporary, exciting landing page providing images of temples and temple attending activities and must include the following:
A call to action to make a hotel reservation
Readily available navigation and contact information for the hotel chain
Summary information about a temple of your choosing

The temple page describes the details for at least four temples of your choice providing information about the address, telephone, email, services, history, ordinance schedule, session schedule, temple closure schedule (from a JSON source), and summary—current weather information obtained from a third party API.
