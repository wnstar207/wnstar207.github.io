        <h3>Fingerhut</h3>
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fingerhut.com">fingerhut.com</a><br>

            Fingerhut uses visual heirarchy to encourage people to apply for their credit card. This screenshot shows that the "Apply Now" button is bigger than the buttons to shop by categories.
        </p>
        <h3>Scouts</h3>

            <img class="screenshot" src="images/scouts.jpg" alt="screenshot of BSA mobile site"><br>
            Scouting.org also uses visual heirarchy. Here they have placed the button to "Find Scouts in Your Area" first as you scroll down the page.

        <h2 class="section-head">Fitt's Law</h2>
        <h3>Kaiser</h3>
        <a target="_blank" href="http://m.kp.org">m.kp.org</a><br>
        <p>
            <img class="screenshot" src="images/kaiser1.jpg" alt="screenshot of Kaiser's mobile website"><br>
            Kaiser Permanente uses Fitt's Law to make it easier to navigate their website. On the login screen, the user id and password text areas, as well as the login button are large and prominent. Other helpful links, such as ID and password help, are smaller and lower on the page.<br>
            <img class="screenshot" src="images/kaiser2.jpg" alt="screenshot of Kaiser's mobile website"><br>
            Once you're logged in, the website continues using Fitt's Law. This screenshot shows the notification area is larger and higher than other links on the page. I don't have any notifications at the moment, but if I did they would be displayed here, with links to view more details.

    <!--hick's law, too many choices, autozone-->
        <section id="hicks-law">
        <h2 class="section-head">Hick's Law</h2>
        <h3>AutoZone</h3>
         <a target="_blank" href="http://www.autozone.com">autozone.com</a><br>
        <p>
            <img class="screenshot" src="images/autozone1.jpg" alt="screenshot of AutoZone's mobile website"><br>
            AutoZone uses Hick's Law and filters to make their website easier to navigate. As an automotive parts store, they have more than 200,000 car parts you could buy. In this screenshot you can see that they offer nearly 50 thousand parts in the brakes and traction control category alone. Trying to find the right part would be a difficult task.<br>
            <img class="screenshot" src="images/autozone2.jpg" alt="screenshot of AutoZone's mobile website"><br>
            Fortunately, AutoZone allows you to input your particular car to narrow your results. Here you can see that the list of brakes and traction control parts that fit <i>my</i> car is much smaller, less than 50.
